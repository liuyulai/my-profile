<h2>✈TRAVEL✈</h2> 
<p> I like to travel to different countries and places. I prefer natural scenery to cultural history because beautiful scenery makes people happy. It can let me put down the pressure and ease my troubles.
</p> 
<p>Compared with the mountains, I prefer the sea, because the sea is generally more vast and extensive. I was most impressed by the sea of China, Bali, Greece and the United States. </p> 
<p>I have been to about 20 countries, including Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Canada, the United States, the Bahamas, Russia, Greece, Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Morocco. Only Oceania and South America have never been there. I am very proud.
